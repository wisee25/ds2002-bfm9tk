    "This assignment was extremely beneficial in terms of improving my ability to manipulate and filter data. Firstly, it helped me to realize the importance of inspecting and cleaning your data before conducting any analysis. Throughout the assignment, I was constantly changing the data types of variables and manipulating the DataFrame in various other ways. This method is unorganized and inefficient. Instead, I should be doing the data cleaning and preparation in advance of trying to answer any questions. Second, I improved my ability to recognize how individual lines of code are structured and on what data types I can use certain methods."

    "The most challenging aspect of this assignment was the final question. I was struggling with applying methods to and understanding the grouped object. To overcome this, I had to really force myself to learn more about that data type. I displayed the data in several different ways and was finally able to understand it enough to know what code to use and to be able to explain exactly what I was doing."

    "The data analysis techniques I used here can be applied to a variety of other situations. In particular, the analysis structure that I realized in retrospect that I should've been using works in any context. The ability to understand what parts of your data need cleaning and to efficiently undertake the cleaning is something that I didn't realize would be such a big part of data analysis. Having already cleaned data when working through analysis makes the analysis more effective and less time-consuming. Additionally, it prevents you from having to look through code to understand where you made a change. In the future, I will be applying the methods I learned in this assignment to any analysis I do."
